# Piratenpartij.nl Themes

This repository contains all themes currently installed on the piratenpartij.nl server.

## Active Theme Development

The theme that we're actively developing is a child theme called PiratenPartij Nederland in the `pp-nl` folder. This theme is dependent on the Genesis Framework theme being installed as well. 

## How to collaborate

We're using the wonderful [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) model for development. This, in short, means you're free to create a feature branch off of the develop branch and offer that as a Pull Request to our develop branch.
